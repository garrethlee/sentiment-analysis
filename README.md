# Sentiment Analyzer

Sentiment analysis is a thoroughly researched and discussed topic, but the field is still making improvements and discovering new techniques every day. While there are plenty of pre-trained models capable of achieving incredible precision in detecting sentiment, I wanted to create my own implementation trained from data that is cleaned and processed from its raw, textual form. *An end-to-end project, so to say* 😲
